5. How was the administration of the Ahom state-organized?
Answer:
Administration of Ahoms

The Ahom state depended upon forced labour.
The forced workers were called paiks.
A census of the population was taken.
Each village had to send a number of paiks by rotation.
People from heavily populated areas were shifted to less populated places. — Ahom clans were thus broken up.
By the first half of the seventeenth century, the administration became quite centralised.


6. What changes took place in vama-based society?
Answer: The following changes took place in uama-based society:

Smaller castes or jatis emerged within vamas.
On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis.
Specialised artisans such as smiths, carpenters and masons were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas.
Jatis rather than vama became the basis for organising society.
Among the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful.
Many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society.
Many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam. They continued to reject the caste-system.

She was the daughter of Salbahan, the Chandel Rajput raja of Mahoba.

8. Were the Banjaras important for the economy?
Answer: The Banjaras were very important for the economy. They were trader-nomads and controlled trade and commerce. They played an important role in transporting grain to the city markets. They usually bought grain where it was cheaply available and carried it to places where it was dearer. From there, they again reloaded their oxen with anything that could be profitably sold in other places.

9. In what ways was the history of the Gonds different from that of the Ahoms? Were there any similarities?
